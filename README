Belcarra USBLAN driver
======================

This repository will contain my cleanup work on the Belcarra driver,
to the point where it can be merged into some 2.6.4x kernel without
cringing :-).

The Belcarra USBLAN driver is useful to talking to some devices
implementing the interface, such as certain Motorola products.
